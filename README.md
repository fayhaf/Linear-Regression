# Quantitative Stock Price Model Optimization
Downloaded the most recent three months of stock prices for all 6 stocks. Created a function that runs a linear regression model on a data set with an unspecified number of predictors and outputs both the coefficients and their associated p-vals. Chose to use forward subset selection with adjusted R^2.
